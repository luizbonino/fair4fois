# Metadata schemas for FOIS
Metadata schema for the Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS) conference

FOIS authors should make the artefacts related to their submitted papers FAIR by following these steps:

1. Make your research artifact available (publish it) in an accessible online location suitable for the type of artifact in consideration. E.g., ontology repository (e.g., Bioportal, OLS, OBOFoundry, Linked Open Vocabularies), GitHub repository, generic repositories such as Zenodo, Dataverse, FigShare, etc. (FAIR principle A1).
2. In many cases, these online repositories provide you with a globally unique and persistent identifier for your artifact. If not, please use available identification services such as PURL.org or W3ID.org to create an identifier for your artifact. (FAIR principle F1)
3. Identify the type of your artifact (e.g., ontology, dataset, methodology) and fill in the metadata record using one of the [available metadata templates](#metadata-schemas-for) (FAIR principles F2, R1.1, R1.2, R1.3)
4. Submit the metadata record (the filled metadata template) together with the submitted paper.
